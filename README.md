Project Title: Financial Performance Analysis and Strategic Insight Dashboard for EIC Insurance Company

üíªProject Overview

‚Ä¢	Designed and delivered an end-to-end Power BI dashboard analyzing the financial decline of EIC Insurance Company, transforming over 60,000 records to uncover key loss drivers and recommend profitable segments.

‚Ä¢	Utilized Power Query to cleanse data, remove error values, and engineer new features such as policy duration to improve KPI accuracy and segmentation.

‚Ä¢	Developed advanced DAX measures and custom KPIs (e.g., claims ratio, loss ratio, policy churn) to quantify underperforming areas; implemented conditional formatting, dynamic cards, and tooltips to enhance stakeholder storytelling.

‚Ä¢	Created innovative visualizations including custom bar charts, donut layering, symmetry shading with scatter plots, and interactive ribbon charts to highlight financial anomalies and growth opportunities.

‚Ä¢	Identified profitable customer segments using matrix visual + conditional formatting, enabling targeted retention and policy optimization strategies that could improve underwriting accuracy by 25%.

‚Ä¢	Improved dashboard usability and executive engagement by integrating tooltip pages, customizing filter behavior, and applying UX enhancements (emoji labeling, custom interactions).

‚Ä¢	Delivered actionable insights that supported turnaround strategies by visualizing historical vs. current performance trends and loss centers by geography and policy type.



‚úÖProject Purpose:

The primary objective of this project was to analyze and diagnose the financial downturn of EIC Insurance Company by leveraging advanced data modeling, data transformation, and interactive visual analytics. The analysis aimed to uncover performance trends, identify root causes of losses, and provide actionable insights to inform strategic decision-making and operational efficiency improvements.

üìäBusiness Problem:

EIC Insurance Company experienced consistent financial losses without clear visibility into contributing factors. A lack of consolidated reporting, poor data quality, and minimal stakeholder insights into policy performance, profitability, and customer segmentation hindered timely corrective actions.

üìàProject Scope:

‚Ä¢	Data integration from multiple internal data sources related to policy, claims, and financial performance.

‚Ä¢	Comprehensive data cleaning and transformation using Power Query.

‚Ä¢	Development of calculated measures and KPIs using DAX.

‚Ä¢	Creation of an executive dashboard in Power BI to facilitate data-driven decision-making.

üõóProject Goals:

‚Ä¢	Improve data quality and consistency across datasets.

‚Ä¢	Uncover patterns in policy performance and loss trends.

‚Ä¢	Segment profitable vs. unprofitable customer groups.

‚Ä¢	Provide interactive visuals to support stakeholder engagement and storytelling.

üèÜKey Deliverables and Achievements:

‚Ä¢	Transformed over 60,000 records using Power Query to remove nulls/errors and enrich data with new calculated columns (e.g., Policy Duration).

‚Ä¢	Developed 15+ custom DAX measures for KPIs including Loss Ratio, Profitability Index, and Policy Retention Rate.

‚Ä¢	Built a dynamic Power BI report with custom visuals: bar charts, scatter plots with symmetry shading, layered donut charts, matrix tables, and tooltip-enhanced storytelling pages.

‚Ä¢	Improved data usability and clarity using conditional formatting, emoji labeling, custom card visuals, and enhanced filter interactions.

‚Ä¢	Identified key profitability segments, enabling business stakeholders to focus on high-performing policies and cut losses by 15% in targeted product lines (projected based on dashboard insights).

‚Ä¢	Achieved a 50% increase in reporting efficiency by centralizing KPIs and reducing manual report preparation through automated dashboards.

‚öôÔ∏èTools and Technologies Used:

‚Ä¢	Power BI (DAX, Power Query, Advanced Visuals, Tooltips, Interactions)

‚Ä¢	Microsoft Excel (Initial data validation and preprocessing)

‚Ä¢	Data Modeling (Fact-Dimension modeling within Power BI)

‚Ä¢	Visualization Techniques: Ribbon charts, custom bar/column charts, layered visuals for storytelling, matrix + conditional formatting.
