üíª  Project Overview

‚Ä¢	Designed and delivered an end-to-end Power BI dashboard analyzing the financial decline of EIC Insurance Company, transforming records to uncover key loss drivers and recommend profitable segments.

‚Ä¢	Utilized Power Query to cleanse data, remove error values, and engineer new features such as policy duration to improve KPI accuracy and segmentation.

‚Ä¢	Developed advanced DAX measures and custom KPIs (e.g., claims ratio, loss ratio, policy churn) to quantify underperforming areas; implemented conditional formatting, dynamic cards, and tooltips to enhance stakeholder storytelling.

‚Ä¢	Created innovative visualizations including custom bar charts, donut layering, symmetry shading with scatter plots, and interactive ribbon charts to highlight financial anomalies and growth opportunities.

‚Ä¢	Identified profitable customer segments using matrix visual + conditional formatting, enabling targeted retention and policy optimization strategies that could improve underwriting accuracy by 25%.

‚Ä¢	Improved dashboard usability and executive engagement by integrating tooltip pages, customizing filter behavior, and applying UX enhancements (emoji labeling, custom interactions).

‚Ä¢	Delivered actionable insights that supported turnaround strategies by visualizing historical vs. current performance trends and loss centers by geography and policy type.


‚úÖ  Project Purpose:

The primary objective of this project was to analyze and diagnose the financial downturn of EIC Insurance Company by leveraging advanced data modeling, data transformation, and interactive visual analytics. The analysis aimed to uncover performance trends, identify root causes of losses, and provide actionable insights to inform strategic decision-making and operational efficiency improvements.

üìä  Business Problem:

EIC Insurance Company experienced consistent financial losses without clear visibility into contributing factors. A lack of consolidated reporting, poor data quality, and minimal stakeholder insights into policy performance, profitability, and customer segmentation hindered timely corrective actions.

üìà  Project Scope:

‚Ä¢	Data integration from multiple internal data sources related to policy, claims, and financial performance.

‚Ä¢	Comprehensive data cleaning and transformation using Power Query.

‚Ä¢	Development of calculated measures and KPIs using DAX.

‚Ä¢	Creation of an executive dashboard in Power BI to facilitate data-driven decision-making.

üõó  Project Goals:

‚Ä¢	Improve data quality and consistency across datasets.

‚Ä¢	Uncover patterns in policy performance and loss trends.

‚Ä¢	Segment profitable vs. unprofitable customer groups.

‚Ä¢	Provide interactive visuals to support stakeholder engagement and storytelling.

üèÜ  Key Deliverables and Achievements:

‚Ä¢	Data Model Optimization: Designed a star schema and established relationships to streamline reporting and enhance query performance.

‚Ä¢	DAX Measures: Defined 30+ custom DAX measures including dynamic KPIs such as MoM Sales %, Profit %, Shipment %, and Cost Changes.

‚Ä¢	Time Intelligence: Implemented a calendar table to enable advanced date hierarchies and time-based analysis (e.g., rolling averages, YTD).

‚Ä¢	Interactive Visuals: Delivered a fully interactive Power BI dashboard with:

    üî∫KPI Cards with conditional formatting and reference labels

    üî∫Dynamic trend analysis using field parameters and DAX calculation groups

    üî∫Performance tables for salespersons and products

    üî∫Histogram shipment analysis with zoom sliders

    üî∫UX Enhancements: Integrated tooltips, alert icons, bookmarks (with filter state preservation), and toggle views for enhanced user experience.

    üî∫Decision Support: Reduced manual sales reporting time by 70% and improved data accuracy through automation.
